Assignment 2
Note:
- Please download starting files (attached below) of your programming language and code on it, submit only these files to Moodle (do NOT submit whole project folder).
- Make sure your code compile (test on turing)
- You may not share or copy code, including code posted on the internet.  You must give credit to sources in comments included in your code.

A)
Class:                                    Assignment2A
Method:                              String makePalindrome(String input)
 
- Palindrome is string that reads the same backward or forward.
- Write program to add characters to the right end of input to make a shortest palindrome.
 
Constraints: Length of the String input is from 1 to 50, and contains only lowercase letters.
 
Example:
·         makePalindrome (“fg”)
o   Return “fgf”  
o   Note: “fggf” is also a valid palindrome, but we choose the shortest palindrome
·         makePalindrome (“ababba”)
o   Return “ababbaba”
·         makePalindrome (“reviver”)
o   Return “reviver”


B)
Class:                                    Assignment2B
Method:                              int numPalindrome(String input)
 
- Write program to return the number of substrings of input that are palindrome
- A substring is defined as a group of contiguous characters
 
Constraints: Length of the String input is from 1 to 5000, and contains only lowercase letters.
 
Example:
·         numPalindrome (“dad”)
o   Return: 4
o   4 substrings that are palindrome: {d, a, d, dad}
·         numPalindrome (“xabcba”)
o   Return: 8
o   {x, a, b, c, b, a, abcba, bcb}
·         numPalindrome (“bbb”)
o   Return: 6
o   {b, b, b, bb, bb, bbb}
Note: If your program takes too long to run for a large input on 2B, you might not get full credit.
